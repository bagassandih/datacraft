# ðŸ“š DataCraft

## ðŸ’­ Background Story

**DataCraft** was born out of a simple frustration familiar to most backend developers â€” forgetting column names, second-guessing table relationships, and spending too much time writing complex JOIN queries by hand.

In many projects, a single feature page often involves three or more tables, each connected through multiple relationships. Navigating those connections manually â€” switching between documentation, ER diagrams, and SQL consoles â€” becomes a repetitive and time-consuming process.

The goal behind DataCraft is to make query building **visual, intuitive, and error-proof**.  
A tool that helps developers focus on **what they want to extract**, not **how to write it**.

> In short: **less typing, more thinking.**

## ðŸ§± 1. Technical Challenges & Solutions Summary

| Challenge | Root Cause | Solution | Impact |
|-----------|------------|----------|---------|
| **Vue Flow Performance Degradation** | Rendering 20+ table nodes with 100+ edges causes frame drops | Implemented virtual rendering with viewport-based culling and lazy edge loading | 60fps maintained even with 50+ tables |
| **Complex JOIN Query Generation** | Self-referencing and circular relationships broke query logic | Built dependency graph resolver with cycle detection and topological sorting | Handles recursive CTEs and complex joins |
| **Schema Introspection Latency** | Full schema load for large databases (500+ tables) takes 15â€“30s | Cached metadata with incremental updates + lazy loading | Initial load <2s, subsequent <100ms |
| **State Synchronization Issues** | Canvas (nodes/edges) and SQL state fell out of sync during edits | Implemented single source of truth with reactive state validation | Real-time consistency and preview |
| **Query Execution Security** | Direct query execution risked SQL injection | Parameterized validation + read-only mode | Zero attack surface in production |

## âš¡ 2. Performance Benchmark

| Test Case | Description | Result |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Schema Load (Medium DB)** | 150 tables with relationships | 1.2s avg |
| **Schema Load (Large DB)** | 500+ tables, 1000+ relationships | 2.8s (paginated) |
| **Node Render (Initial)** | 30 nodes rendered | 180ms |
| **Node Render (Incremental)** | Add single node | 15â€“25ms |
| **Query Generation** | 5-table JOIN with filters | 8â€“12ms |
| **Query Execution (Simple)** | 2-table JOIN SELECT | 45â€“80ms |
| **Query Execution (Complex)** | 5-table JOIN with aggregation | 120â€“250ms |
| **Canvas Pan/Zoom** | 40+ nodes | Constant 60fps |

> Benchmarked on MacBook M2, Node 20, MySQL 8.0.

## ðŸ”’ 3. Security Considerations

- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via Knex.js  
- **Read-Only Mode**: Only SELECT operations allowed  
- **Secure Credentials**: Stored as encrypted environment variables  
- **Rate Limiting**: `express-rate-limit` (100 req / 15 min / IP)  
- **Strict CORS**: Only whitelisted domains allowed  
- **Session Timeout**: 30 minutes of inactivity  
- **Audit Logging**: Timestamps, user context, and query fingerprinting  
- **Future Plan**: Role-based access control (RBAC)

## ðŸŽ¨ 4. UI Overview

### 1. **Connection Page**
Minimal and focused. Supports MySQL & PostgreSQL with instant connection testing.

### 2. **Canvas View**
Interactive workspace built with Vue Flow â€” draggable tables, relationship edges, and auto-layout.

### 3. **Query Modifier Panel**
Column selector, JOIN configurator, and WHERE builder with real-time query preview.

### 4. **SQL Preview**
Syntax-highlighted SQL display with execution results and performance metrics.

---

## ðŸ§  5. Design Philosophy

**Clarity over complexity.**  
Every element of DataCraft is designed to reduce mental overhead while writing queries.  

- Visual-first, code-transparent  
- Instant feedback on every change  
- Constraint-based actions to ensure valid SQL  
- Performance that feels instant through incremental rendering  

DataCraft isnâ€™t trying to replace SQL â€” itâ€™s here to make it **easier to think in SQL**.

## ðŸ§© 9. Lessons Learned
The hardest challenge wasnâ€™t query logic â€” it was maintaining perfect synchronization between the canvas state and SQL representation.

The key insight: treat the canvas as a view, not the source of truth.

Another takeaway: perceived speed matters more than real speed. Smooth incremental rendering and feedback loops make users feel in control.

Finally, developers love visual tools, but they trust code. Thatâ€™s why DataCraft always shows the generated SQL â€” transparent, editable, and honest.

## ðŸ’¬ 10. Final Note
DataCraft is an experiment in making SQL feel human again.  
It doesnâ€™t aim to hide complexity â€” just to make it manageable, visual, and intuitive.

Born from the everyday challenges of backend development, DataCraft stands for one philosophy:

> **Less typing. More thinking.**

Built with coffee, code, and curiosity.
